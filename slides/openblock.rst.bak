What is OpenBlock?
------------------

- "Hyper-local news" application framework

- Example news types

----

What Kinds of Sites Might Use OpenBlock?
----------------------------------------

- Sites with a local focus,
- which can benefit from automated news item generation,
- where news item sources already exist online,
- in some user-unfriendly, but regular, fashion

----

OpenBlock History
=================

Presenter Notes
---------------

- Let's take a moment to learn where OpenBlock came from

EveryBlock Source Code
----------------------

.. http://blog.everyblock.com/2009/jun/30/source/

- **July 2009:** the EveryBlock team open sourced core functionality on Google Code
- 7 tarballs available at http://code.google.com/p/ebcode/
- And then what happened?

Presenter Notes
---------------

- Great codebase, lots of potential, but no community around the code yet
- Hard to configure project requirements
- Code was fairly complex, hard for beginners to jump into the project

----

Presenter Notes
---------------

 - Goal is to simplify and accelerate adoption of the open sourced EveryBlock code

----

OpenRural
=========

Presenter Notes
---------------

- Rural news organizations often struggle to move into the digital age because they lack the staff to make public data digestible.
- OpenRural will work with rural governments and community newspapers in North Carolina to collect, aggregate and publish government data.

----

Experiences
===========

----

Columbus County, NC
-------------------

.. image:: ../static/columbus-county-map.png
    :width: 100 %

----

Columbus County, NC v2
----------------------

.. optional version of the county with cities
.. think this helps at all?

.. image:: ../static/nc-columbus-county-cities.png
    :width: 100%

----

Challenging Characteristics of Columbus County
----------------------------------------------

- Multiple "cities"

  - Supported by OpenBlock, but not "default"
  - Different urlpatterns single- vs. multi-city
  - Multi-city urlpatterns include "city slug"

- Unincorporated areas

  - Lots of space not in any town/city
  - These places need names to be navigable
  - Can use census "county subdivision" names
  - ...but these are not meaningful to residents

----

1st Approach: Use Census Files for OpenBlock Data
-------------------------------------------------

- Advantages

  - Code already exists in OpenBlock to use these files
  - Generalizable to other NC counties

- Disadvantages

  - Incomplete/incorrect data
  - 70% success rate geocoding ~38,000 Columbus County addresses

----

Missing Addresses
-----------------

----

Discontiguous Blocks
--------------------

.. image:: ../static/bad-data-discontiguous.png
    :width: 100 %

----

Multi City
--------------------

.. image:: ../static/geocoder-multi-city.png
    :width: 100 %

----

2nd Approach: Use County GIS Department Data
--------------------------------------------

- Advantages

  - More complete/accurate
  - ~38,000 address geocode success rate improved to 93%

- Disadvantages

  - Custom code to load this data (custom BlockImporter)
  - Not generalizable to other counties
  - This data not available for all counties

----

Custom Data Availability in NC
------------------------------

.. image:: ../static/Street_Centerline_Download_County.jpg
    :width: 90 %

----

Geocoding is Still Difficult
----------------------------

- Geocoding is a hard problem to solve
- String parsing
- Places and locations
- Street/block data
- 3rd-party geocoder comparison

----

Scrapers
========

----

What are they?
--------------

Scripts that extract information from online data sources

The process is conceptually simple:

- The script should download some data from the web
- Create one or more NewsItems whose fields are populated with that data
- Save the NewsItem to the database

The grunt work is in extracting the data you need.

----

How They Work
-------------

Scrapers can extract information from websites or tabular data (CSV, etc.)

Common patterns:

- A "list-detail site"
    - Site that displays a list of records, which might be paginated
    - Each record might have its own page -- a "detail" page
    - ``mechanize`` to scrape the pages
    - ``NewsItemListDetailScraper``, ``RssListDetailScraper``
- Scrapers sometimes require more than a single data source
    - CSV/Excel
    - Shapefile
    - Download multiple files and stitch them together locally

----

Extensions
==========

Presenter Notes
---------------

OpenBlock handles scraping and public viewing, but is missing review and analysis

----

The Missing Piece: Data Review and Analysis
-------------------------------------------

- How successful was the geocoder?
- How many news items were added?
- Why is my scraper failing to run?
- Why did this address fail to geocode? How can I correct it?

----

Data Dashboard
==============

----

Data Dashboard
--------------

.. image:: ../static/datadashboard-runs.png
    :width: 100 %

Presenter Notes
---------------

- Keeps track of each run for every scraper, including execution time and status
- Filter on status to only see important runs (scraper freq, lots of skips)
- Manually initiate scraper run and delete all news items associated to the scraper

----

Data Dashboard
--------------

.. image:: ../static/datadashboard-stats.png
    :width: 100 %

Presenter Notes
---------------

- High level statistics for each run
- Includes geocoding exceptions
- Support for custom counters
- Option field to record comments

----

Data Dashboard
--------------

.. image:: ../static/datadashboard-failures.png
    :width: 100 %

Presenter Notes
---------------

- Detailed list of failures
- Figuring out why these failed requires some digging

----

Data Dashboard
--------------

.. code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 4

    from openrural.data_dashboard.scrapers import DashboardMixin
    from openrural.retrieval.base.scraperwiki import ScraperWikiScraper

    class CorporationsScraper(DashboardMixin, ScraperWikiScraper):

        # scraper settings
        logname = 'corporations'
        schema_slugs = ('corporations',)

Presenter Notes
---------------

- Simple Mix-in class to use Data Dashboard
- Handles all stats and metrics by default, but you can add more

----

Conclusion
----------

- State of the OpenBlock community
- Our plans in North Carolina
